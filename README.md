## General Information
- Modelling the price of houses
- Use the model of multiple linear regression
- Apply lasso and ridge regularization to it

## Conclusions
- Hill side property has highest price, banked one has lowest
- Concrete foundation has highest prices followed by wood and stone
- Single-family and townhouse end unit seem to have higher sale prices in general
- Houses with excellent exterior condition and specially Imitation Stucco, Vinyl or Stone exterior covering have highest prices
- Houses with shed and hip roof style seem to have higher prices, although not much difference in prices based on roof style in general
- Stone type of masonry veneer has highest sale price
- More the number of storeys (and finished storeys), higher the sale price
- Higher the quality of basement, higher the sale price
- Basements with average and good living quarters have the highest prices
- Excellent and good qualtiy garage houses have higher sale price than the poor quality ones
- Furnished garage houses as well as built-in garage houses have higher sale prices
- Similarly, higher the quality of kitchen, fireplace and heating, higher the sale price of house
- Newly constructed sale type or the ones with 15% down payment have highest price
- New partially constructed homes have highest price while adjoining land purchase has lowest price
- Houses with NorthRidge, NorthRidge Heights and Stone Brook in vicinity have highest prices
- Houses with Iowa, Meadow Village and Briardale in vicinity have highest prices
